<h1>Ephox Textbox.io Release Notes</h1>
<p>
					This document contains information on changes between versions of Textbox.io.
					For more detail and working examples, please consult the developer documentation.
					Older changelog entries are available on the <a href="http://ephox.com/releases">Ephox releases site</a>.
				</p>
    <h2>Textbox.io 1.3.0.345</h2>
<h3>Please Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>The link information popup that appeared when the cursor is in a link has been removed</li>
<li>A loading spinner will now be displayed when the editor resources take more than a second to load. Most API calls still work in this state, but document interactions will throw an error.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/locale">locale</a> and <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/languages">languages</a> configuration options have moved into the ui object. The old configuration propertes are ignored.</li>
<li>The mobile editor UI currently renders on top of all other page elements and blocks touch events outside of the editor. Using a custom button to open a dialog can render the editor unusable on mobile.</li>
<li>Using more than one unique value for editor locale on a page is not supported</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved table model for selection, navigation, and clipboard support, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Navigating tables now happens in natural order, instead of DOM order (up moves cursor up, not left)</li>
          <li>Using the mouse or keyboard to select cells now creates a custom highlighted selection</li>
          <li>Merging cells can be performed via the table context menu</li>
          <li>Unmerging cells can be performed via the table context menu</li>
          <li>Copying selected cells will copy just those cells to the clipboard, adding blank cells to fill in any gaps if the selection is not rectangular</li>
          <li>Pasting a table into a table will merge the contents into the target table. This process will add columns and rows or unmerge cells as necessary to ensure the table remains rectangular.</li>
          <li>Copying table cells from within the editor will retain HTML styles on paste regardless of the paste configuration setting to preserve editor table styling</li>
          <li>Rows can now be resized, just like columns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li>Table cell formatting commands available on the toolbar when the cursor is within a table. These items can be disabled using the contextual property of the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/toolbar">toolbar</a> configuration.
        <ul>
          <li>Cell background color</li>

          <li>Editor adheres to the recommendations set forth in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</li>

          <li>Improved accessibility help text</li>
          <li>Editor ARIA label can be configured using the <span style="font-family: monospace">aria-label</span> property of the <a href="http://docs.ephox.com/display/tbio/ui">ui</a> configuration</li>
          <li>Focus consistently returns to the editor after using the toolbar, menus or dialogs</li>

          <li>Alignment buttons in dialogs are announced as (and behave like) radio buttons</li>
          <li>Insert image from Web URL dialog announces the status and informational text to screen readers</li>
